        <h1>Fisch-what is this?</h1>
        <p>Fisch is a Roblox experience originally developed by Nate. Its official release was on October 5, 2024. It is an open-world adventure and exploration game in which the primary goal is to catch Fish for profit, bestiary progression and completing quests.</p>
        <h2>About rods</h2>
<p>Fishing Rods are the main tool used for catching Fish. There are currently 163 fishing rods in Fisch - each with their own benefits and drawbacks, making no particular rod in a stage objectively better than the others. Owned rods are stored in the Equipment Bag.</p>

<h3>About enchants.</h3>
<p class="a">There are currently 28 standard enchantments in the game, along with 8 Exalted enchantments, 7 Cosmic enchantments, 7 Twisted enchantments, 3 Limited enchantments and 1 Quest-exclusive Enchantment.

All regular enchantments have an equal 1/28 chance of being rolled. It is impossible to obtain the same enchantment twice, so this rate becomes 1/27 (~3.703%) on an already-enchanted rod.
All Exalted enchantments have an equal (1/8) chance of being rolled. This rate becomes 1/7 (~14,28%) with a rod already possessing an Exalted enchantment.
All Cosmic enchantments have an equal (1/7) chance of being rolled. This rate becomes 1/6 (~16.67%) with a rod already possessing a Cosmic enchantment.</p>
<h4>Something special.</h4>
<p class="b">"Fisch admin abuse" refers to an event, not a single past instance. It happens at specific times, typically starting around 4:00 PM UK time and lasting for about an hour. </p>

<h5>The forge-what is this?</h5>
<p>"The Forge" is a popular Roblox RPG experience where players mine resources, fight enemies, and craft them into powerful weapons and armor. 
Gameplay Overview
Core Loop: The main objective is to travel into a cave, mine for different ores and minerals, bring them back to your forge, and craft gear.
Progression: By selling the items you forge, you earn money to upgrade your tools, which allows you to mine better materials and face stronger enemies deeper in the cave system.
Combat & Exploration: The caves contain mobs that guard higher-rarity areas. Defeating enemies is necessary for progression, and some specific enemies drop valuable runes needed for certain crafts.
RNG & Quality: The game heavily features an element of chance (RNG) in aspects like obtaining rare ores and the quality of crafted items. </p>

<h6>Races</h6>
