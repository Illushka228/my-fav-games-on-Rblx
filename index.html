        <h2>Fisch-what is this?</h2>
        <p>Fisch is a Roblox experience originally developed by Nate. Its official release was on October 5, 2024. It is an open-world adventure and exploration game in which the primary goal is to catch Fish for profit, bestiary progression and completing quests.</p>
        <h2>About rods</h2>
<p>Fishing Rods are the main tool used for catching Fish. There are currently 163 fishing rods in Fisch - each with their own benefits and drawbacks, making no particular rod in a stage objectively better than the others. Owned rods are stored in the Equipment Bag.</p>

<h2>About enchants.</h2>
<p class="a">There are currently 28 standard enchantments in the game, along with 8 Exalted enchantments, 7 Cosmic enchantments, 7 Twisted enchantments, 3 Limited enchantments and 1 Quest-exclusive Enchantment.

All regular enchantments have an equal 1/28 chance of being rolled. It is impossible to obtain the same enchantment twice, so this rate becomes 1/27 (~3.703%) on an already-enchanted rod.
All Exalted enchantments have an equal (1/8) chance of being rolled. This rate becomes 1/7 (~14,28%) with a rod already possessing an Exalted enchantment.
All Cosmic enchantments have an equal (1/7) chance of being rolled. This rate becomes 1/6 (~16.67%) with a rod already possessing a Cosmic enchantment.</p>
<h2>Something special.</h2>
<p class="b">"Fisch admin abuse" refers to an event, not a single past instance. It happens at specific times, typically starting around 4:00 PM UK time and lasting for about an hour. </p>

<h3 id="TheForge">The forge-what is this?</h3>
<p>"The Forge" is a popular Roblox RPG experience where players mine resources, fight enemies, and craft them into powerful weapons and armor. 
Gameplay Overview
Core Loop: The main objective is to travel into a cave, mine for different ores and minerals, bring them back to your forge, and craft gear.
Progression: By selling the items you forge, you earn money to upgrade your tools, which allows you to mine better materials and face stronger enemies deeper in the cave system.
Combat & Exploration: The caves contain mobs that guard higher-rarity areas. Defeating enemies is necessary for progression, and some specific enemies drop valuable runes needed for certain crafts.
RNG & Quality: The game heavily features an element of chance (RNG) in aspects like obtaining rare ores and the quality of crafted items. </p>

<h4>Races</h4>
<p>Races in The Forge determine a player's innate traits, stat bonuses, and special abilities. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses and is assigned randomly, ranging from common to mythical in rarity.

In The Forge, Races provide the player with additional unique benefits and visual appearances.
